ABOUT
=====

A script to maintain own mini-distribution for debian.

The goal is to have a single-command step between "git push" and "apt-get update && apt-get install".
Or maybe even zero, if I ever put it to cron, though one is good enough for me.

Most probably there is already something whcih does just this, but for now
assembling my own is faster than learning what I saw. I try to maximize use of
existing tools.

INSTALL
=======

Work from any place, but requires some preparation.

1. Install packages: sbuild, schroot, apt-ftparchive
2. $ln -s $PWD/dot.sbuildrc ~/.sbuildrc
3. Add files to home directory:
~/.buildrc.local:------
LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR=directory where all working data will be stored
UPLOAD_DIR=scp url to put the result to
----------------------
~/.sbuildrc.local:-----
{
myname => 'Dohn Doe <a@b.c>',
base_dir => 'same as LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR',
}
----------------------
4. $sudo sbuild-adduser $LOGNAME
   $sbuild-update --keygen
   #sudo sbuild-createchroot wheezy $LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR/chroots/wheezy ftp://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian
